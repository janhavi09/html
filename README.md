<h1> NATURE</h1>
<p> Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural ,physical,material world or universe."Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world,and also to life in general .
The study of nature is large,if not the only,part of science.Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a seperate category from other natural phenomena.
 This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and artificial .
 The term "NATURAL" might also be distuinguished from the unnatural and supernatural.</p>

 <h2> Earth </h2>
 <p2> Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research .Within the solar system,
 it is third closest to the sun ,it is the largest terrestial planet and the fifth largest overall.</p2>

 <h3> Atmosphere,climate, and weather </h3>
 <p3> The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity.
 Air is mostly nitrogen,oxygen,water vapor.

 Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather.various factors are known to influence the climate ,including ocean currents.
 This exposure alternates as the earth revolves in its orbit.At any given time,regardless of season,the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

 Weather is a chaotic system that is readily modified by small changes to the environment, so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days.overall,two things are happening worldwide:
 (1)temperature is increasing on the average;and 
 (2)regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.</p3>

 <h4> Water on the Earth </h4>
 <p4> Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H20) and is vital for known forms of life. In typical usage,water refers only to its liquid form of life.
Additionaly , a minute amount of Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.
OCEANS
An ocean is a major body of saline water,and a principal component of hydrosphere.Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean.
This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.

LAKES
A lake is a terrain feature ,a body of liquid on the surface of liquid on the surface of a world of liquid on the surface of a word that is localized to the bottom of basin.
All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

PONDS
A pond is a body of standing water,either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake.A wide variety of man-made ,that is usually smaller than a lake.
A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds,including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation,fish ponds ,including water gardens designed 
for commercial fish breeding ,and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy.

RIVERS
A river is a natural watercourse,usually freshwater,flowing towards an ocean,a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely
before reaching another body of water. water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge.

STREAMS
A stream is a flowing body of water with a current,confined within a bed and stream banks.In the United states,a stream is classified as a watercause less than 60 feet.</p4>
